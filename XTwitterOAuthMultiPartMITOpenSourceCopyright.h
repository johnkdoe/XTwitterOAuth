	Don’t panic: you can use all my code without paying anything! Having said that, a lot of
	work has gone into creating the code below. If my code saves you some time and trouble,
	and you feel like making a small donation to support my future development efforts, it

    From xolaware ...

	Not certain I understand Daniele modifying the copyright after Jaanus' 2010 copyright.
	I am making no copyright claims on this, and, like Jaanus, i generally follow the MIT
	standard for copyright, so see above.

	I've made almost no meaningful modifications to this code, other than to try and use some
	of the things available in iOS5 like NSJSONSerialization and other things that are in the
	runtime so that this library can have a couple of the excess bits of code removed.

	I've also change the prefix from   DM    to   X.

	Find Daniele's original github library at:  git://github.com/malcommac/DMTwitterOAuth.git
 
	If you find this code useful, thank Daniele & Jaanus.
